# Django E-commerce Application

This is a simple e-commerce web application built using **Django** for the backend and **Bootstrap** for the front-end templated views. This project was developed as my final project for a Python subject last year.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage profiles.
- **Product Listings**: Display products with descriptions, prices, and images.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the cart and manage quantities.
- **Order Management**: Submit orders and view order history.
- **Bootstrap-based UI**: Responsive and mobile-friendly design.
